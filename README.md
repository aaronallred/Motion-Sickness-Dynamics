# Motion-Sickness-Dynamics

This code is intended to serve as an implementation to the motion sickness dynamics model presented in Experimental Brain Research.
Matlab 2022b was used to save the Simulink File, and this version or later is required to run the code.

Within the Main File, you can define a motion profile. 
The motion profile is defined for columns 1-3 are being xyz position and columns 4-6 are xyz rotations.
The environment G-level can also be defined here.

The final output of the file is the following:
